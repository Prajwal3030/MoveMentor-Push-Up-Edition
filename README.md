**Project Title:** MoveMentor: Push-Up Edition

**Objective:**
1. **Pose Detection and Tracking:**
   - Utilize the `PoseDetector` from the `cvzone` library to detect and track keypoints representing a person's pose in each frame of the input video (`vid1.mp4`).

2. **Angle Calculation and Thresholding:**
   - Calculate angles between specific hand landmarks, normalize them, and apply threshold conditions.
   - Increment the push-up count when both left and right hand angles surpass a predefined threshold, providing a robust mechanism for push-up detection.

3. **Real-time Display:**
   - Dynamically display the push-up count on each video frame using OpenCV functions.
   - Write the processed frames to an output video file (`output.avi`), creating an interactive and visual push-up counting experience.

**Steps:**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed, including OpenCV, cvzone, and numpy.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the Python script (`pushup_counter.py`) to start the push-up counting application.

4. **Input Options:**
   - Choose between entering text or uploading an MP3 file.

5. **Speech-to-Text Conversion:**
   - Utilize the SpeechRecognition library to convert audio to text.

6. **Text-to-Speech Conversion:**
   - Utilize gTTS and PyDub for text-to-speech conversion with audio playback.

7. **User-friendly Interface:**
   - Implement user-friendly options for interaction, allowing users to easily input text or upload MP3 files.

8. **Exit Feature:**
   - Include an exit feature to gracefully end the application.

9. **Enhanced User Experience:**
   - Leverage libraries like SpeechRecognition, gTTS, and PyDub to enhance the overall user experience in speech processing.

10. **Output Video:**
    - Save the processed frames with the dynamically displayed push-up count to an output video file (`output.avi`).

11. **GitHub Upload:**
    - Upload the project to GitHub to share the code, documentation, and usage instructions.

12. **Documentation:**
    - Provide clear documentation in the README file, explaining the project, dependencies, and how to run the script.

By following these steps, users can easily set up and run the push-up counter application, leveraging pose detection and real-time display for an engaging experience.
