MoveMentor Push-Up Edition


Import Required Libraries:

Import the necessary libraries, including cv2 for OpenCV, cvzone for additional computer vision functions, and other standard libraries like math and numpy.
Initialize Variables:

Set initial values for variables like counter and direction.
Open the video file using cv2.VideoCapture.
Create a PoseDetector object from cvzone to detect and track human poses.
Video Writer Setup:

Get the frames per second (fps) and total number of frames in the input video.
Define the codec and create a VideoWriter object to write the processed frames to an output video file.
Define Angle Calculation Function:

Implement a function (angles) to calculate angles between specified key points on the detected human pose.
Perform angle conversions and interpolations for better visualization.
Update global variables like counter and direction based on the calculated angles.
Main Processing Loop:

Start a loop to read frames from the input video using cv2.VideoCapture.
Resize each frame for consistency.
Use cvzone to add a title to the processed frames.
Utilize the PoseDetector to find and track the human pose in each frame.
Extract landmarks and bounding box information from the pose detection results.
Call the angles function to calculate angles and update push-up count and direction.
Draw points on the frame if specified.
Write the processed frame to the output video using VideoWriter.
User Interaction:

Break the processing loop if the user presses the 'q' key.
Release video capture and writing resources.
Cleanup:

Release all resources (video capture, video writer, and any open windows).
Execution:

Execute the script, and it will process the input video, detecting and counting push-ups based on hand angles.
