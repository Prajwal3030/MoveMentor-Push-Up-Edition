**Project Objectives:**

1. **Real-time Pose Detection:**
   - Utilize the `PoseDetector` from `cvzone` for real-time human pose detection in video frames.

2. **Angle Calculation:**
   - Calculate angles between specific key points of the detected human pose, focusing on hand angles relevant to push-up exercises.

3. **Push-Up Counting:**
   - Implement a push-up counting mechanism based on changes in hand angles during the exercise.

4. **Direction Tracking:**
   - Track the direction of the push-up movement to distinguish between upward and downward phases.

5. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Provide visual feedback on the processed frames, including the title "AI Push Up Counter" and the current push-up count.

6. **Output Video Creation:**
   - Generate an output video file containing the processed frames with added visual elements.

7. **User Interaction:**
   - Allow the user to stop the processing loop and exit the application by pressing the 'q' key.

8. **Parameter Tuning:**
   - Adjust parameters such as tracking and detection confidence thresholds (`trackCon` and `detectionCon`), as well as angle thresholds, to optimize push-up detection.

9. **Documentation:**
   - Include comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of each part of the code.

10. **Visualization Enhancement:**
    - Optionally, enhance visualization by adding more points and lines to the detected pose, providing additional insights into the exercise form.

11. **Video Size Adjustment:**
    - Resize input frames to a consistent size (1000x500 in this case) for uniform processing and visualization.

12. **Output Video Format:**
    - Save the processed frames as an output video in the AVI format with the XVID codec.

13. **Modular Code Design:**
    - Implement a modular code structure by defining functions for specific tasks like angle calculation, frame processing, and user interaction.

14. **Optimization:**
    - Optimize the code for performance and efficiency to handle real-time processing effectively.

**Steps to Achieve Objectives:**

1. **Import Required Libraries:**
   - Import necessary libraries, including OpenCV, `cvzone`, `math`, and `numpy`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set initial values for variables such as `counter` and `direction`.
   - Open the video file using `cv2.VideoCapture`.
   - Create a `PoseDetector` object for pose tracking.

3. **Video Writer Setup:**
   - Get video properties (fps, total frames) and set up a `VideoWriter` object for output.

4. **Define Angle Calculation Function:**
   - Implement the `angles` function to calculate relevant angles and update global variables.

5. **Main Processing Loop:**
   - Read frames from the input video.
   - Resize frames and add a title using `cvzone`.
   - Use `PoseDetector` to find and track human poses.
   - Extract landmarks and bounding box information.
   - Call the `angles` function to calculate angles and update push-up count and direction.
   - Write the processed frame to the output video.

6. **User Interaction:**
   - Break the processing loop if the user presses the 'q' key.

7. **Cleanup:**
   - Release all resources (video capture, video writer, and any open windows).

8. **Execution:**
   - Execute the script, and it will process the input video, detecting and counting push-ups based on hand angles.

By following these steps, the project aims to create a functional push-up counter with real-time pose detection and visual feedback. Adjustments and enhancements can be made based on specific use cases and requirements.
